So if i've made a template defining where my resources are, the process is:

*)Go to the build page
*)Click "Create New Build"
*)CCHQ goes to the hg repo, pulls the newest copy of their resources
*)CCHQ finds the most recent copy of CommCare.jad and CommCare.jar
*)CCHQ surgically inserts the resources into the jar file, changes the names of the jar/jad files, and updates the jad properties appropriately
*)CCHQ puts the new build in the "All Unreleased Builds" list
*)The build is downloaded and tested
*)The user clicks "Make Release"
*) The release process is followed as normal.
